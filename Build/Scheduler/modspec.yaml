# Example specification for which modules are included in a project.
#
# Rules:
# 1) Package requirements are not recursive
# 2) A package requirement without an include or exclude defaults to including all modules in that package
# 3) A package MAY have EITHER an include or exclude module filter, but not both
# 4) An include filter means that ONLY those modules listed will be included under the package
# 5) An exclude filter means that ALL modules EXCEPT those listed will be included under the package
